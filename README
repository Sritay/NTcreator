This folder consists of utilites to generate components of a
boron nitride membrane.

The file "bnntcreator.cpp" consists of a C++ script which
generates a boron nitride nanotube. The nanotube is 
generated by first creating a planer sheet, then rolling it
about the chiral axis. 
To compile: g++ bnntcreator.cpp
To run: ./a.out m n length
Where 'm,n' is the nanotube chirality, and 'length' is the
nanotube length.

The file "h_pore_creator.cpp" consists of a C++ script which
takes an existing 2-D boron nitride sheet and creates a 
pore in the shape of an n-sided polygon at the centre of the 
sheet. It tries to ensure that parity is maintained between
the number of boron and nitrogen atoms in the sheet. Finally,
dangling bonds due to the pore creation are identified and 
hydrogenised.
To compile: g++ h_pore_creator.cpp
To run: ./a.out
