# Boron Nitride membrane creator
This folder consists of utilites to generate components of a
boron nitride membrane.

## BNNT creator
The file "bnntcreator.cpp" consists of a C++ script which
generates a boron nitride nanotube. The nanotube is 
generated by first creating a planer sheet, then rolling it
about the chiral axis. 

To compile:
```
g++ bnntcreator.cpp
```
To run: 
```
./a.out m n length
```
Where 'm,n' is the nanotube chirality, and 'length' is the
nanotube length. The output is in the xyz file format, with 
the columns standing for atom type, x, y and z respectively.
The nanotube is contained in the file named 'BNNT'.

## Hydrogenised pore creator
The file "h_pore_creator.cpp" consists of a C++ script which
takes an existing 2-D boron nitride sheet (here, provided as 
the file 'bnpsheet.xyz') and creates a pore in the shape of an
n-sided polygon at the centre of the sheet. It tries to ensure
that parity is maintained betweenthe number of boron and 
nitrogen atoms in the sheet. Finally, dangling bonds due to 
the pore creation are identified and hydrogenised.

To compile: 
```
g++ h_pore_creator.cpp
```
To run: 
```
./a.out
```
The output is in the xyz format, in the file 'hbn_sheet.xyz'. 
The columns correspond to atom ID, atom type, x, y and z 
respectively.
